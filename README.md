- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Cyekeh

The project contains two steps:
Step1: 
Please write a MIPS program to prompt the user to input a integer number N (N >= 25) from the console. Then check whether the input number N is legal or not. If N is  0 or negative number or any positive number less then 25, it is regarded as illegal and your program should display an error message saying "Illegal Number!" and prompt the user to input another integer number N again. Keep doing this until the user input a legal number N (i.e., a positive integer >= 25). 
Step 2:
With the legal number N above from Step 1, please print the first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. Note that each number in the Fibonacci sequence should be calculated using MIPS instructions. After that please run your MIPS program using SPIM software to display the result in the output (console) window. Please make sure your program is complete and runs correctly under SPIM software. 
What to submit:  
All development must be done with Github. The Github repo must stay private. Specifically, there MUST BE ONE COMMIT for EVERY five (or fewer for the end of program) lines of MIPS code (excluding empty lines, and lines with only comment/directives/labels). More frequent commit is fine. Each commit must carry a message describing the purpose of the changes. The commits must be done while you write the code. Commits after the development completion is NOT ACCETPABLE
Add 'OnionKnightChong' (the TA) as collaborators to your Github repository.
Create a plain text file named readme.txt. Such a file can be created with notepad on Windows and nano on MacOS or Linux. The file should include ONLY the link to your Github repository that can be used to clone your repo.
Submit the readme.txt file to Canvas under "Project Assignment".
<!---
Cyekeh/Cyekeh is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
